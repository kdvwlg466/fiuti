# Fiuti Google Ads Tool: Build Campaigns 20x Faster, Save Hours, Boost ROI

If you're drowning in spreadsheets while building Google Ads campaigns, wondering why setting up a Single Keyword Ad Group (SKAG) structure takes half your workday, you're not alone. Most digital marketers and agencies spend 5-6 hours manually creating campaign structures that could be automated in minutes. That's where Fiuti comes in—a specialized PPC tool that's changing how professionals approach Google Ads campaign building.

## What Actually Is Fiuti?

Fiuti is a SaaS platform designed specifically for one thing: helping marketers build and optimize Google Ads campaigns at lightning speed. Think of it as your campaign construction crew—what used to take you an entire afternoon now happens in under 30 minutes.

The tool specializes in creating both SKAG (Single Keyword Ad Group) and STAG (Single Theme Ad Group) campaigns, which are proven strategies for improving Quality Scores and reducing cost-per-click. Instead of manually replicating ad groups, setting up negative keywords, and organizing campaign structures, Fiuti automates the heavy lifting while you focus on strategy.

Based in New York, Fiuti has positioned itself as a specialized solution in the PPC management space. It doesn't try to do everything—it just does campaign building exceptionally well.

## Core Features That Actually Matter

**Keyword Planner**
The keyword planner helps you discover new, relevant keywords sorted by competition and search volume. You can either input your existing keyword list or use a website URL as a starting point to extract keyword ideas. It's straightforward and gets you from research to campaign in minutes.

**Campaign Builder**
This is where Fiuti shines. The campaign builder automatically generates SKAG or STAG structures with proper match types (exact, phrase, and broad match modifiers). It cross-matches ad groups to create unique negative keyword lists for each group—something that's tedious and error-prone when done manually.

The builder exports campaigns as Google Ads Editor-compatible CSV files, so you can review everything before uploading.

**Keyword Mixer**
Need to generate variations? The keyword mixer lets you append and prepend terms to create comprehensive keyword lists. It's particularly useful when you need to scale campaigns across multiple product lines or locations.

**Ads & Extension Generator**
Create expanded text ads, responsive search ads, and ad extensions directly within Fiuti. You can use custom variables for each ad group, making it easy to personalize messaging at scale.

## Pricing Breakdown: Simple, No Hidden Fees

Fiuti keeps pricing refreshingly straightforward—no complicated tiers or surprise charges.

| Plan | Price | Billing Cycle | What You Get |
|------|-------|---------------|--------------|
| Free Trial | $0 | One-time | Generate one campaign report to test the platform |
| Monthly | $65 | Monthly |  [**Unlimited campaigns, up to 10 team members, all features**](https://fiuti.com) |
| Quarterly | $49/month | Every 3 months ($147 total) |  [**Save $16/month vs monthly plan, same unlimited access**](https://fiuti.com) |

Both paid plans include:
- Unlimited campaign exports
- Up to 10 team members at no extra cost
- All platform features (keyword planner, mixer, campaign builder, ad generator)
- One-click cancellation anytime
- Google Ads Editor-compatible CSV exports

The quarterly plan represents a 25% savings compared to the monthly option. For agencies building multiple campaigns monthly, that's $192 saved annually—enough to justify a team lunch or two.

## Who's This Actually For?

Fiuti works best for:

**PPC Agencies**: If you're managing multiple client accounts and building new campaigns regularly, Fiuti can dramatically reduce billable hours spent on campaign setup. Several agencies report recouping the subscription cost after setting up just 2-3 client campaigns.

**In-House Marketing Teams**: Teams running their own Google Ads who need to test campaign variations quickly without dedicating full days to manual setup.

**Freelance PPC Consultants**: Solo practitioners who need to deliver professional-grade campaign structures efficiently without the overhead of larger tools.

It's less ideal if you're only running one or two campaigns per year—the ROI just isn't there for occasional use.

## Real User Experiences

George Bradley, a marketing team lead, mentioned the tool is "quickly becoming one of our most valuable tools" because it lets their team test new campaigns much faster. The simplicity is what stands out to him.

An agency reviewer on Capterra said building SKAG campaigns used to consume 5-6 hours, but Fiuti reduced that to 30 minutes. They specifically noted it's "absolutely necessary for an advertising agency" at its price point.

Another user highlighted the bulk ad group creation capability: "The ability to create ad groups/ads in bulk has really improved our account set up efficiency."

The consistent theme across reviews is time savings. People aren't raving about fancy dashboards or AI features—they're relieved they can finally build campaign structures without losing half their day.

## The SKAG Advantage (and Why It Matters)

If you're not familiar with SKAGs, here's the quick version: Single Keyword Ad Groups mean having one keyword per ad group instead of lumping multiple keywords together. This lets you create hyper-targeted ads that match exactly what people search for.

Why bother? Higher Quality Scores, better click-through rates, and lower CPCs. When your ad headline exactly matches what someone types into Google, they're more likely to click.

The catch is that SKAGs are tedious to set up manually. You need separate ad groups for each keyword, different match types for each, and negative keywords to prevent ad groups from competing against each other. Miss one negative keyword and your ad groups start cannibalizing each other's impressions.

Fiuti handles this automatically. You input your keywords, and it generates the entire structure with proper negative keyword lists in minutes.

## Limitations to Know About

Fiuti is specialized, which means it doesn't try to be an all-in-one PPC platform. It won't replace tools for bid management, analytics, or performance tracking. It's purely for campaign construction.

The tool is tested up to 1,000 ad groups per export. While that's generous, extremely large enterprises with massive campaigns might hit practical limits.

Some users mentioned wanting a feature to create single theme campaigns with one ad group containing all match types per campaign. Currently, you'll need to structure that manually.

## How Fiuti Compares to Alternatives

Competitors like Adalysis ($126+/month) and Optmyzr ($49+/month) offer broader PPC management features but at significantly higher price points. They include bid optimization, automated rules, and reporting dashboards.

Fiuti's approach is different—it does one thing (campaign building) really well at a lower price. If you need comprehensive PPC management, you'll want a fuller-featured tool. If you just need to build campaign structures efficiently, Fiuti's specialized focus is an advantage, not a limitation.

At $39-65/month (depending on your plan choice), it's priced for regular use rather than enterprise-only budgets.

## Getting Started

The free trial lets you generate one complete campaign report without entering payment details. You can test the keyword planner, build a sample campaign, and see if the workflow fits your needs.

If you decide to subscribe, the quarterly plan offers the best value. The $16/month savings adds up, especially for agencies building multiple campaigns monthly.

## Bottom Line

Fiuti solves a specific problem: campaign building takes too long. If you regularly create Google Ads campaigns with SKAG or STAG structures, the time savings alone justify the cost after a couple of uses.

It won't revolutionize your entire PPC strategy, manage bids, or generate performance reports. But it will give you back hours each week that you can spend on strategy, analysis, or literally anything besides copying and pasting keywords into spreadsheets.

For agencies and teams building campaigns regularly, that's worth considerably more than $49-65 per month.
